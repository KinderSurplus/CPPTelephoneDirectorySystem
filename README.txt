Hello and welcome!

This project is a small telephone directory system. It can temporarily store names and phone numbers, and has CRUD functionality
(Create, Read, Update, Delete). In this project you will also find a user manual that will explain how to use it.

I created this project using the CLion IDE, but feel free to use anything capable of compiling C++ code.

Thanks for checking my project out.
